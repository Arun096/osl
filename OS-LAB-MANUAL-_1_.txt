AIM:
	To study and execute the UNIX Commands.
Introduction to UNIX:
	UNIX was developed by AT&T Bell laboratories by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie with the intension of creating a portable operating system. It was finally written in C and now runs on all machines from notebooks to mainframes. The term UNIX is derived from UNICS (UNiplexed Information Computing System).It is an interactive, multiuser and multitasking operating system and it is suitable for programming and system research projects. It supports individual user, small groups or entire departments on a wide range. It manages memory and disk space.
UNIX COMMANDS
1. Date Command:
	This command is used to display the current data and time.

Ex.No:	3	IMPLEMENT THE CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS
Date:		        a) FCFS  	b) SJFS	c) Priority	d) Round Robin 
            
AIM:
                  To implement FCFS, SJF, Priority and Round robin scheduling algorithms using C.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

FIRST COME FIRST SERVE SCHEDULING:
	With this scheme, the process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first.  The implementation of the FCFS policy is easily managed with a FIFO queue.  The FCFS scheduling algorithm is nonpreemptive.  Once the CPU has been allocated to a process, that process keeps the CPU until it releases the CPU either by terminating or by requesting I/O.  While considering the performance of the FCFS scheduling algorithm, the higher burst time process makes the lower burst time process to wait for a long time.  This effect is known as convoy effect.
SHORTEST JOB FIRST SCHEDULING:
      This algorithm associates with each process the length of the latter's next CPU burst.  When the CPU is available, it is assigned to the process that has the smallest next CPU burst.  If two processes have the same length next CPU burst, FCFS scheduling is used to break the tie.  The SJF algorithm may be either preemptive or nonpreemptive.  The choice arises when a new process arrives at the ready queue while a previous process is executing.  The SJF scheduling algorithm is provably optimal, in that it gives the minimum average waiting time for a given set of processes.
PRIORITY SCHEDULING:
      A priority is associated with each process and the CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority.  Equal priority processes are scheduled in FCFS order.  An SJF algorithm is simply a priority algorithm where the priority(p) is the inverse of the next CPU burst.  The larger the CPU burst, the lower the priority and vice versa.
ROUND-ROBIN SCHEDULING:      
      The round-robin scheduling algorithm is designed especially for time-sharing systems.  It is similar to FCFS scheduling, but preemption is added to switch between processes.  A small unit of time, called a time quantum is defined.  A time quantum is generally from 10 to 100 milliseconds.  The ready queue is treated as circular queue.

ALGORITHM:
1: Initialize all the structure elements
2: Receive inputs from the user to fill process id,burst time and arrival time.
3: Calculate the waiting time for all the process id.
          i)  The waiting time for first instance of a process is calculated as:
                           a[i].waittime=count + a[i].arrivt
          ii) The waiting time for the rest of the instances of the process is calculated as:
               a) If the time quantum is greater than the remaining burst time then waiting time
is calculated as:
    a[i].waittime=count + tq
               b) Else if the time quantum is greater than the remaining burst time then waiting
time is calculated as:

AIM:

                     To write a C program to implement an Algorithm to detect Deadlock.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
                                  Deadlock detection is the process of actually determining that a deadlock exists and identifying the process and resources involved in the deadlock. The basic idea is to check the allocation against resource availability for all possible allocation sequences to determine if the system is in deadlocked state,
			The omplexity of algorithm is O(N2) where N is the number of proceeds. Another potential problem is starvation; same process killed repeatedly.


ALGORITHM:

1: Get the no of processes.
2: Get the process numbers.
3: Get the no of resources types and instances of it.
4: Get Max demand of each process of n x m matrices.
5: Get the n x m matrices the number of resources of each type currently allocated to each process.
6: Calculate the n x m of the remaining resource need of each process.
7: Initialize work as available resource and array of finish to false.
8: Check the Needed resource is lesser than the available resource if not display the System not in safe state and if it is lesser than system in safe state.
9: Initialize work as sum of work and allocation, check if array of finish is true go to step 7 again if not go to step 8.
10: Check that request can be immediately granted.
11: If single request is lesser than or equal to available if true means arrive to new state.
12: Print the sequence if it is in safe state or print not in safe state.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
                     
               There are possibilities of side effects of preventing deadlocks and low device utilization reduced system throughput. When a new process enters the system, it must declare the maximum number of instances of each resource type that it may need. This number may not exceed the total number of resources in the system. 
                    When a user requests a set of resources, the system must determine whether the allocation of these resources will leave the system in a safe state. It will, the resource are allocated, otherwise the process must wait until some other process releases enough resources.

1: Get the no of processes.
2: Get the process numbers.
3: Get the no of resources types and instances of it.

Ex.No:	7	IMPLEMENT ALL FILE ALLOCATION STRATEGIES
Date:			a) Sequential 	b) Indexed 	c) Linked
AIM :
	To implement the various file allocation techniques.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
a)Sequential file allocation strategy: In this type of strategy, the files are allocated in a sequential manner such that there is a continuity among the various parts or fragments of the file.
b)Indexed file allocation strategy: In this type of strategy, the files are allocated based on the indexes that are created for each fragment of the file such that each and every similar indexed file is maintained by the primary index thereby providing flow to the file fragments.
c)Linked file allocation strategy: In this type of strategy, the files are allocated in a linked list format where each and every fragment is linked to the other file through either addresses or pointers. Thus, the starting location of the file serves for the purpose of extraction of the entire file because every fragment is linked to each other.

a) Sequential File Allocation 
Algorithm:
1. Declare the starting block no. and the length of the file.
2. Get the Starting block no. and length of the file from the user. 
3. Allocate files sequentially until end of the file. 
4. Display the fragments of the file. 
Program:
#include<stdio.h>

SAMPLE INPUT AND OUTPUT:


b) Linked File Allocation 
Algorithm:
1. Initialize the AVAIL linked list, where each node consist of starting address, size of the empty block and a link for next available node 
2. Initialialize the FAT ( File Allocation Table) which is implemented as array of pointers.
3. Display the AVAIL List 
4. Read File allocation request which consist of File name, No of blocks and its contents
5. Traverse the AVAIL linked list from the starting node
6. Retrieve the required no of blocks from AVAIL List
7. Assign the contents of file to the retrieved blocks 
8. Update the FAT by making an entry in FAT 
9. Update the AVAIL LIST
10. Display the AVAIL List and FAT table

Ex.No:8       IMPLEMENTION OF PRODUCER-CONSUMER PROBLEM USING
Date: 					 SEMAPHORES

AIM:
           To write a C program to implement the Producer & consumer Problem (Semaphore).

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
      The producer-consumer problem (also known as the bounded-buffer problem) is a classical example of a multi-process synchronization problem. The problem describes two processes, the producer and the consumer, who share a common, fixed-size buffer. The producer's job is to generate a piece of data, put it into the buffer and start again. At the same time the consumer is consuming the data (i.e. removing it from the buffer) one piece at a time. The problem is to make sure that the producer won't try to add data into the buffer if it's full and that the consumer won't try to remove data from an empty buffer. The solution for the producer is to go to sleep if the buffer is full. The next time the consumer removes an item from the buffer, it wakes up the producer who starts to fill the buffer again. In the same way the consumer goes to sleep if it finds the buffer to be empty. The next time the producer puts data into the buffer, it wakes up the sleeping consumer. The solution can be reached by means of inter-process communication, typically using semaphores. An inadequate solution could result in a deadlock where both processes are waiting to be awakened.
ALGORITHM:
1: The Semaphore mutex, full & empty are initialized.
2: In the case of producer process
      a)Produce an item in to temporary variable.
            b)If there is empty space in the buffer check the mutex value for enter into the critical section.
            c)If the mutex value is 0, allow the producer to add value in the temporary variable to the buffer.
3: In the case of consumer process
a)It should wait if the buffer is empty
b)If there is any item in the buffer check for mutex value, if the mutex==0,remove item from buffer
c)Signal the mutex value and reduce the empty value by 1.Consume the item.
4:  Print the result

Ex.No:9       IMPLEMENTION OF SINGLE & TWO LEVEL DIRECTORIES
Date: 					

AIM:
      To implement the single & two level directory.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

a) Single level directory:
                     In a single-level directory system, all the files are placed in one directory. This is very common on single-user OS's. A single-level directory has significant limitations, however, when the number of files increases or when there is more than one user. Since all files are in the same directory, they must have unique names. If there are two users who call their data file "test", then the unique-name rule is violated. Although file names are generally selected to reflect the content of the file, they are often quite limited in length. Even with a single-user, as the number of files increases; it becomes difficult to remember the names of all the files in order to create only files with unique names.
b) Two level directory:
                      In the two-level directory system, the system maintains a master block that has one entry for each user. This master block contains the addresses of the directory of the users. There are still problems with two-level directory structure. This structure effectively isolates one user from another. This is an advantage when the users are completely independent, but a disadvantage when the users want to cooperate on some task and access files of other users. Some systems simply do not allow local files to be accessed by other users.

DAG
A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph with no directed cycles that is formed by a collection of vertices and directed edges with each edge connecting one vertex to another, such that there is no way to start at some vertex v and follow a sequence of edges that eventually loops back to v again. 
Algorithm:
Step 1: Start the Program 
Step 2:Obtain the required data through char and int datatypes.
 Step 3:Enter the filename,index block. Step 4: Print the file name index loop. 
Step 5:File is allocated to the unused index blocks 
Step 6: DAG is allocated to the unused linked allocation. 
Step 7: Stop the execution

Ex.No.	10	IMPLEMENTATION OF PAGE REPLACEMENT ALGORITHMS
Date:				(FIFO, LFU and LRU)

AIM:
	To implement the page replacement algorithms.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

   When a page fault occurs, the operating system has to choose a page to remove from memory to make room for the page that has to be brought in.
* FIFO (First in first out): When a page must be replaced, the oldest page is chosen.
* LRU (Least Recently Used): When a page must be replaced, LRU chooses the page that has not been used for the longest period of time.
* LFU (Least Frequently Used): It refers to the removal of the page that will not be used in the future, for the longest period of time.
FIFO:
Algorithm:
 1. Start the algorithm
 2. Read the number of frames 
 3. Read the number of pages 
 4. Read the page numbers 
 5. Initialize the values in frames to -1
 6. Allocate the pages in to frames in First in first out order. 
 7. Display the number of page faults.
 8. Stop the algorithm.

EX NO:12 IMPLEMENTATION OF THREADING AND SYNCHRONIZATION

AIM
	To write a C program to implement threading and synchronization 

ALGORITHM
Step 1: Start the Program 
Step 2: Initialize the threads with the pthread_t data type.
Step 3: Create threads using pthread_create function.
Step 4: If the thread identifier is equal to the created pthread_id then the first thread will 
      be processed otherwise the second thread will be processed.
Step 5: After the execution of one thread the cpu is kept idle for 5 units of time using 
	sleep.
Step 6: Stop the program.

PROGRAM
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
#include<pthread.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<unistd.h>
pthread_t tid[2];
void* doSomeThing(void *arg)
{
    unsigned long i = 0;
    pthread_t id = pthread_self();
    if(pthread_equal(id,tid[0]))
    {
        printf("\n First thread processing\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("\n Second thread processing\n");
    }
    for(i=0; i<(0xFFFFFFFF);i++);
    return NULL;
}
int main(void)
{
    int i = 0;
    int err;
    while(i < 2)
    {
        err = pthread_create(&(tid[i]), NULL, &doSomeThing, NULL);
        if (err != 0)
            printf("\ncan't create thread :[%s]", strerror(err));
        else
            printf("\n Thread created successfully\n");
        i++;
    }
    sleep(5);
    return 0;
}


OUTPUT
-bash-3.2$ gcc threadpgm.c -lpthread
-bash-3.2$ ./a.out                               
Thread created successfully
First thread processing
Thread created successfully
Second thread processing





















CONCLUSION:
     Thus the program to implement threading and synchronization executed and verified.

IMPLEMENTATION OF MEMORY ALLOCATION 

AIM:
	  To implement first fit, best fit and worst fit using C.

ALGORITHM:

1: Get the number of free space available.
2: Get the starting address of each free space and how much space available.
3:.While getting the address and space we have to check whether there is duplication,if there is a duplication  then give the error message for duplication & get the address and space once again.
4: Get the space for the process.
5: If choice is first fit, then search the first memory location from the available list its size should be greater than or equal to the process size an or equal to available space in fifo order.
6: .If choice is best fit, and then sort the available list in ascending order based on the space. and search the first memory location from the available list its size should be greater than or equal to the process size an or equal to available space in FIFO order.
7: .If choice is worst fit, then sort the available list in descending order based on the space. and search the first memory location from the available list its size should be greater than or equal to the process size an or equal to available space in FIFO order.
8: If there is no sufficient space output the error message.
9: Display the process and its corresponding allocated memory space
